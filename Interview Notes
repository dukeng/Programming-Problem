Sort by multiple keys:
s = sorted(s, key = lambda x: (x[1], x[2]))




Note:

- Sliding window or keep two indices pointing to the start and end is a great way to iterate an array in linear time. This is also used in questions like “find 2 numbers in a sorted array that sum to M”.
- When you need to compare things regardless of order (like anagram), you may consider hash, hash map.

- When stuck, answer outloud 3 questions: what you are working on, what’s your current problem and what doesn’t work.
