What is object? Object is a runtime entity and its state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.

Class consist of three types of variables: local variables (in function), instance variables (outside function), class variable (static)

Singleton class: Singleton class control object creation, limiting the number to one but allowing the flexibility to create more objects if the situation changes.

Three step for creating an Object: An Object is first declared, then instantiated and then it is initialized.

Four types of Access Modifier: public, private, protected and default(package)

Variable used in switch statement can only be: string, enum, byte, short, int, or char.

String class is immutable: once created cant be changed.

Finalize: It is possible to define a method that will be called just before an object's final destruction by the garbage collector. This method is called finalize( ), and it can be used to ensure that an object terminates cleanly.

Abstract class: These classes cannot be instantiated and are either partially implemented or not at all implemented. This class contains one or more abstract methods which are simply method declarations without a body.

Encapsulation: It is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. Therefore encapsulation is also referred to as data hiding.

Abstraction: It refers to the ability to make a class abstract in OOP. It helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system.

Interface: An interface is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

Can a constructor be made final? No

Static block: It is used to initialize the static data member, It is excuted before main method at the time of classloading.

Overloading: If a class has multiple functions by same name but different parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

Overriding: If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class, it is known as Method Overriding.
